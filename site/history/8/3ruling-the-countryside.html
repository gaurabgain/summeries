	</header>
		<h2>THE COMPANY BECOMES THE DIWAN</h2>
		<p>
			On august 12 1765, the mughal emperor appointed the east india compnay
			as the diwan of bengal. As diwan, the company became the chief
			financial administrator, now it had to think of administration and
			collecting revenue. The collection of revenue had to be done in such a
			way that it could meet the expenses of the company.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Revenue for the company-</h3>
		<p>
			Within five years of becoming diwan, the company bought double the
			amonut of goods than earlier purchases. Earlier it had purchased goods
			in india by imported gold and silver from britain. Now the revenue
			collected in bengal could finance the puchase of goods for export.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Bengal famine-</h3>
		<p>
			As the company began purchasing cheap goods, the artisans were
			deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to
			the company at low price. Peasants were unable to pay dues to the
			moneylenders. Due to  all those problems agricultural production was
			collapsed heavily. This led to a famine in 1770 when about ten million
			people, which was about one-third of the population of bengal was wiped
			out.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">The need to improve agriculture-</h3>
		<p>
			The company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms
			of the settlement the rajas and talukdars were recognised as zamindars.
			They were asked to collect rent from peasants and pay the fixed
			revenue to the company. The revenue was fixed permanently, which means
			it will not increase. The company officials thought that the revenue
			demand of the state would be fixed and the zamindar would benefit from
			any increased production from the land.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Initial problem to zamindars-</h3>
		<p>
			The zamindars didn't invested in improving the land. The revenue that
			was fixed for the zamindars were unaffordable to zamindars. They lost
			their zamindari if they failed to pay revenue. The company organised
			auctions to sold zamindari.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Loss of expected revenue to company in early 19th century-
		</h3>
		<p>
			In early decade of 19th century, cutivation expanded and markets rose.
			This led to increase in income of zamindar and no gain to the company.
			The company could not demand more revenue, because it was fixed
			earlier.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Problem to the cultivator-</h3>
		<p>
			The cultivators found this system of fixed revenue extremely
			oppressive. The rent that to be paid to zamindars were high and the
			cultivator had no securtiy over the land. To pay rent cultivator often
			take money from moneylender. If they fail to return money to the
			moneylender, they were evicted from the land.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Mahalwari system-</h3>
		<p>
			Devised by Holt Mackenzie in 1822. Under this system the estimated
			revenue has to be paid by the village(mahal). The charge of collecting
			revenue was given to the village headman. The revenues were collected
			based on the measurements and assessment from each of the plots within
			a village and the sum total ammonut was to be paid to the company.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">The munro system-</h3>
		<p>
			In munro system, the fields were surveyed separately and revenue
			assessment were made directly with traditional cultivators. This
			system is was called ryotwari. This system was applied on the south,
			some of the areas which were captured by the company after war with
			tipu sultan,because there were no tradional zamindars.
		</p>
		<h2>CROPS FOR EUROPE</h2>
		<p>
			British realised india could grow crops that have market in Europe.
			They started pursuading cultivators to produce other crops: jute in
			bengal, tea in assam, sugarcane in united provices (uttar pradesh),
			wheat in punjab, cotton in maharastra and punjab, rice in madras.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Demand for indigo-</h3>
		<p>
			Indigo plant grows primarily in tropics. Indian indigo was used as
			early as thirteenth century in the european market, but it was
			expensive. Another plant named woad was used to dye clother. Woad was
			cheap but produce pale dull colour. Where as indigo produce rich blue
			color.
		</p>
		<p>
			Indigo import was earlier banned in europe, however by seventeenth
			century, cloth producers in europe persuaded governments to relax ban
			on indigo import. French began cultivating indigo in St domingue in
			carribean, Portuguese in brazil, English in Jamaica , Spanish in
			venezuela.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Indian indigo</h3>
		<p>
			British began production of indigo in bengal. In 1788 about 30% of
			indigo in britain was imported form india, but by 1810, it had gone
			upto 95%. Many company officials left thier job to look after their
			indigo business. Many english and scottish came to india to become
			planters.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Indigo cultivation systems - nij cultivation-</h3>
		<p>
			In nij cutltivation planter planted indigo in own land. The planter
			had full control over the land. They then hire workers to produce
			indigo.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Problems with nij cultivation-</h3>
		<p>
			Indigo production had to be done in large scale to remain profitable.
			Indigo required fertile land to grow. Fertile land was scatterd. It
			required a large workforce and equipments to grow indigo. All of
			those were challenging because workers and equipments were being used
			in rice field at that same time.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Ryot cultivation of indigo-</h3>
		<p>
			Under ryoti cultivation planters force ryots to sign a contract.
			Those who signed contract got cash from planters at low interest
			rates. Planters also provided seed. The loan commited the ryots to
			cultivate indigo on atleast 25 percent of land of their control. When
			crop was delivered to planter after harvest, a new loan was given to
			the ryot.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Problems with ryot cultivation-</h3>
		<p>
			Ryots got new loan everytime from planters after delivering indigo.
			Peasants soon realised that the price they got for the indigo was
			very low and the loan cycle never ended.
		</p>
		<p>
			Planter insist peasants that indigo had to be cultivated on the most
			fertile land which peasants prefer to cultivate rice. Indigo had deep
			roots and exhausted the soil fertility rapildy, making the soil
			difficult to sow rice.
		</p>
		<h2>THE BLUE REBELLION AND AFTERMATH</h2>
		<p>
			In march 1859 thousands of ryots refused to grow indigo. They refused
			to pay rents to planters, those who worked for planters were socially
			boycotted. Ryots attacked indigo factories with traditional weapons
			of that time, with spears, swords, bow and arrows, womens attacked
			with kitchen utensils.
		</p>
		<p>
			Indigo ryots got support from local zamindars and villege headmen,
			because they too felt oppressed working for planters. Some zamindars
			even went around villages urging ryots to resist the planters.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the news of revolt spread across many parts, the lieutenant
			governer toured the region. In barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden
			issed a notice stating ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo
			contracts.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the rebellion spread, the govenrnment brought military to protect
			planters from assult. Indigo Commission was set up to enquire into
			the system of indigo production. The commission held planters guilty
			and criticised them for the coercive methords they used with indigo
			cultivators.
		</p>
		<p>
			The commision declared that indigo cultivation was not profitable for
			ryots. The ryots were asked to fulfil their exsisting contract and
			they can refuse to produce indigo in future.
		<p>
		<h3 class="self">Aftermath</h3>
		<p>
			The discovery of synthetic dyes in late nineteenth century the indigo
			business was severely affected. After revolt in bengal, indigo
			production collapsed there. The planters shifted their operation in
			bihar. Mahatma Gandhi's visit to champaran in 1917 marked the
			beginning of the champaran movement against indigo planters.
