				<li>As peoples were dissatisfied with british rule, they had some
				 	questions within them.</li>
				<li>People had questions as like, What is this country of india?
				 	For whom it is meant?</li>
				<li>The answer that gradually emerged was, India was the people of
				 	india, all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste ,
				 	creed, language, gender.</li>
				<li>India, the country, its resources and systems were meant for
				 	all of them.</li>
				<li>Peoples realised that british were exercising control over
				 	resources of india and over people, and india could not be
				 	india until the control of british end.</li>

				 	formation of political associations after 1850. Mostly in
				 	1870s and 1880s.</li>
				<li>Some notable associations were, Poona sarvajanik sabha, the
				 	indian association, the madras mahajan sabha, the bombay

				 	wealth to england, since most of the high post in
				 	administration had white officials and they were sending
				 	major part of their salaries to home.</li>
				<li>White officials had their monopoly in jobs in administration.

				<li>Bengal was the largest province of british india at that
					time. It comprised of bengal,bihar and parts of odisha.</li>
				<li>The british gave "administrative convenience" as reason for
					the partiton of bengal. The convenience was closely tied to
					the interests of british officials and businessman.</li>
				<li>Instead of removing the non-bengali areas from the province,
					the government separated east bengal and merged it with assam.
					</li>
				<li>Perhaps the main british motives were to limit the influence
					of bengali politicians and to split the bengali people.</li>
				<br>
				<li>The partition of bengal angered people all over india. All
					sections of the congress- the moderates and the radicals
					opposed it.</li>

				 	methods of mass protest developed.</li>

					encourage ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national
					education and use of indian languages.</li>

				<li>It desired separate electorates for muslims. In 1909
					govenrment admited this demand.</li>
				<li>Some seats in the councils were now reserved for muslim
					candidates who would be elected by muslim voters. This tempted
					politicians to gather following by distributing favours to
					their own religious groups.</li>
