				time. It comprised of bengal,bihar and parts of odisha.</li>
			<li>The british gave "administrative convenience" as reason for
				the partiton of bengal. The convenience was closely tied to
				the interests of british officials and businessman.</li>
			<li>Instead of removing the non-bengali areas from the province,
				the government separated east bengal and merged it with assam.
				</li>
			<li>Perhaps the main british motives were to limit the influence
				of bengali politicians and to split the bengali people.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The partition of bengal angered people all over india. All
				sections of the congress- the moderates and the radicals
				opposed it.</li>
			<li>Large public meetings and demonstration were organise and new
				methods of mass protest developed.</li>

			<li>It desired separate electorates for muslims. In 1909
				govenrment admited this demand.</li>
			<li>Some seats in the councils were now reserved for muslim
				candidates who would be elected by muslim voters. This tempted
				politicians to gather following by distributing favours to
				their own religious groups.</li>
