			<h1>From Trade to Territory: The Company Establishes Power</h1>
		</header>
		<!-- <h2>>> SHORT SUMMARY</h2> -->
		<h3 class="self">Company got exclusive right-</h3>
		<ul>
			<div class="ul-content">
			<li>
			East india company got a charter from queen elizabeth 1 which gave it
			a exclusive right to trade with east. With these power it purchased
			cheap goods and sold them expensive in europe.
			</li>
			<li>
			However the royal charter is can not be appllied on other european
			powers. Other european powers such as french,portuguese,dutch etc also
			had a presence in east. That led to competion,battle,blockade of ships
			between them. Companies made fortified trading posts and trade is
			guarded with weapons.
			</li>
			</div>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="self">East india company in bengal-</h3>
		<p>
			In 1651 first english factory was set up at banks of hugli river. As
			merchants are started settling near english factory for good trade, by
			1696 british started building fort around the factory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shortly after, british got zamindari rights over three villages by
			bribing mughal officials. Kalikata was one of those villages, which
			later grew into city Calcutta.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aurangzeb issued a farman granting only the company the right to trade
			duty free. British missused this privilage. Officials of the company
			doing business on the side were expected to pay duty, which they
			refused, causing loss of revenue for mughals.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Trade to battles-</h3>
		<p>
			After death of aurangzed, the bengal nawabs asserted thier power.
			Murshid Quli Khan followed by Alivardi Khan then Sirajuddaulah were
			the nawabs of bengal.
		</p>
		<p>
			They were strong rulers, and opposed many of the company's wrong
			practices. These conflicts led to battle of plassey.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Battle of plassey(1757)-</h3>
		<p>
			After death of alivardi khan, sirajuddaulah became nawab. Worried
			company officials tried to put a puppet ruler in place of the nawab.
			Sirajuddaulah demanded not to interfere in political affairs, stop
			factory fortification and pay the revenues.
		</p>
		<p>
			After failed negotiations, nawab attacked factory with 30000 soldiers
			at kassimbazar captured officals,warehouse and blockaded english
			ships. Then captured company fort at calcutta.
		</p>
		<p>
			After defeat at calcutta, british send solders from madras under
			command of robert clive. After failure of prolonged neotiations with
			nawab, in 1757 robert clive led company's army against nawab at
			plassey. Company's army got victory and sirajuddaulah got assasinated.
		</p>
		<p>
			The battle of plassey became the first major victory of company won in
			india. After victory the company put a puppet ruler named Mir Jafar in
			place of Sirajuddaulah. Mir jafar was one of the commanders of
			sirajuddaulah. Robert clive won his support by promising to make him
			nawab after crushing sirajuddaulah. In exchange, the force led by mir
			jafar didnot fought the battle. This was one of the main reasons for
			the defeat of sirajuddaulah.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Battle of buxar(1764)-</h3>
		<p>
			Puppet rulers were not always cooperative to the company because they
			also have to maintain basic dignity and sovereignty to get get respect
			from their subjects. Mir jafar protested, company put another puppet
			in place of him named Mir qasim. When Mir qasim protested, he was
			defeated by Mir jafar with the help of company, in battle of buxar.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Diwan of provinces of Bengal-</h3>
		<p>
			After death of Mir jaffar in 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the
			company as the Diwan of provices of bengal. It allowed the company to
			use the revenue resources of bengal. The revenues were so vast that
			it could finance company expenses like purchase of goods, maintenance
			of troops, fortification of company factories.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to huge revenue, the company didn't need to import gold and
			silver from britain for its trade. The revenue covered all the
			expenses.
		</p>
		<h3>Company officials became NABOBS-</h3>
		<p>
			Nabob is an anglicised term of the word nawab. After battle of buxar
			company officals earned huge amounts of money and property. Although
			many officials died early deaths due to war or diseases, those who
			managed to return to Britain with wealth, lived a comfortable life in
			britain. They led flashy lives and flauted their riches. They were
			seen as social climbers in british society and ridiculed in plays and
			cartoons.
		</p>
		<h2>COMPANY RULE EXPANDS</h2>
		<p>
			The tactic that company used to annex indian kingdoms was various
			political, economic and diplomatic methords. Company appointed its
			workers in various indian states. The workers were political or
			commmercial agents and their job was to propagate the interests of
			the company. Using workers company interfered in internal affairs in
			indian states, deciding the successors of the states etc.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">Subsidiary alliance-</h3>
		<p>
			Under this alliance indian rulers were not allowed to have their
			independent army and they ware to be protected by the army of the
			company. In exchenge of protection they have to pay money to the
			company. If a ruler was failed to pay the expense, then part of their
			territory was taken by company as penalty.
		</p>
		<h3>Tipu Sultan - The "Tiger of Mysore"-</h3>
		<p>
			Mysore was a powerful state under leadership of Haider Ali (ruled
			1761-1782) and his son Tipu Sultan (ruled 1782-1799). Profitable
			malabar coast was under Mysore where in 1785 Tipu sultan stopped the
			export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom and not allowed local
			merchants to trade with company.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tipu had close relationship with french, due to which british fought
			4 wars with mysore (1767-69, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799) and won the
			last war- the battle of Seringapatam. In the last war tipu died
			defending his capital seringapatam. After his death, Mysore was
			placed under the ruling dynasty of Wodeyars and subsidiary alliance
			was imposed on the state.
		</p>
		<h3>War with the Marathas-</h3>
		<p>
			After Third Battle of Panipat, Maratha was divided into many states
			each under a different chief. The chiefs are held together in a
			confederacy under a peshwa, who is the military and administrative
			head.
		</p>
		<p>
			First anglo-maratha war, ended in 1782 with treaty of Salbai, had no
			clear victory. Second anglo-maratha war (1803-05), British gained
			orissa and territories of north of yamuna including agra and
			delhi.Third anglo-maratha war lost by marathas, peshwa was removed.
		</p>
		<h3>Claim to paramountcy-</h3>
		<p>
			The policy of <strong>"paramonutcy"</strong> is intitiated under Lord
			Hastings. The company now claimed that its authority was paramount or
			supreme. Hence its power was greater than indian states. So to protect
			company's interest it started annexing or threatning to annex indian
			kingdoms.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was challenged by queen of kittor, Rani Channamma. She led an anti-
			british resistance movement.She was arrested in 1824 and died in
			1829. Rayanna, a chowkidar of sangoli in kittor continued the
			resistance. He was caught in 1830 and hanged.
		</p>
		<h3 class="self">War in north-west-</h3>
		<p>
			In late 1830s, company was worried about rising Russia. To take
			control of noth-west, compnay fought war with afghanistan between
			1838 and 1842. In 1843 they take over on Sindh. In 1849,punjab was
			annexed.
		</p>
		<h3>The doctrine of lapse-</h3>
		<p>
			This doctrine declared that if and indian ruler died without a male
			heir, his kingdom would "lapse".This policy was given by Lord
			Dalhousie (governer general 1848-1856).
		</p>
		<p>
			Kingdoms, such as Satara(1848), Sambalpur(1850), Udaipur(1852),
			Nagpur(1853), Jhansi(1854) were annexed by applying this doctrine.
		</p>
		<h2>SETTING UP A NEW ADMINISTRATION</h2>
		<ul>
			<div class="ul-content">
			<li>British territories were divided into administrative units called
				presidencies, and there are 3 of them, bengal, madras and bombay.
				Each presidencies were ruled by governers and the supreme head of
				administration was governer-general. The first governer general
				of india was Warren Hastings.</li>
			<li>A collector was the administative head of a district. The main
				job of collector was to collect revenue and taxes and to maintain
				law and order in the district. The office of the collector was
				called as The collectorate.</li>
			<li>Each district was to have 2 courts, criminal court(faujdari
				adalat) and civil court(diwani adalat). This system of justice
				started in 1772.</li>
			<li>Hindu laws are compliled in 1775 and muslims laws are in 1778.
				Under the Regulating Act of 1773, Supreme Court was established.
				</li>
			</div>
		</ul>
		<h3>The company army-</h3>
		<p>
			The compnay army mostly composed of army of local kingdoms, consists
			of cavalry and foot soldiers.
		</p>
		<p>
			In early nineteenth century, british began to develope uniform
			military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to european
			style training. It consists of drills and made discipline among
			soldiers. This created problems because the cast rules and feelings
			were ignored to build professional soldiers.
		</p>
		<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
		<p>
			East india company transformed from a trading company to a territorial
			power. Steam technology helped british colonial ambition. Steamships
			reduced journey time, which enabled more britishers and their family
			members to come to india.
		</p>
		<p>
			By 1857, the company had direct rule over 78% of indian population
			and 63% of indian territory. Company also had indirect influence on
			remaining places, thus virtually controlled whole india.
