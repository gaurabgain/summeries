		<h2>POLICIES AND THE PEOPLE</h2>
		<h3>Nawabs lose their power-</h3>
		<ul>
			<div class="ul-content">
			<li>Since mid-eighteenth century, the power of nawabs and rajas
				started decreasing, due to various policies by east indian 
				company.
				</li>
			<li>Stage by stage the power of rulers, their revenue, territoies, 
			    military are taken away by company.</li>
			<li>Rulers tried to negotiate with company,to protect their power. But
				the company, was confident on its superiority and turned down 
				their requests.</li>
			<li>Rani laxmibai of jhansi wanted the company to recognise her
				adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after death of her
				husband.</li>
			<li>In 1801, subsidiary alliance was imposed over awadh, and in 1856
				it was taken over.</li>
			<li>Governer-general dalhousie declared that awadh territory was
				misgoverned and british rule was needed to ensure proper
				administration.</li>
			<li>Company wanted to end mughal dynasty. In 1849, dalhousie announced
				that after death of bahadur shah zafar, the family of king would
				be shifted out of the red fort and given another place in delhi to
				reside in.</li>
			<li>In 1856, governer-general canning decided that bahadur shah zafar
				would be the last mughal king and after his death none of his
				descendants would be recognised as kings. Instead they would just
				be called princes.</li>
			</div>
		</ul>
		<h3>The peasants and the sepoys-</h3>
		<ul>
			<div class="ul-content">
			<li>In the coutryside peasants and zamindars are didn't liked the high
				taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection.</li>
			<li>Many lost the lands they had tilled for generations.</li>
			<li>Indian sepoys in the employ of the company were unhappy about 
				their pay, allowances and conditions of service.</li>
			<li>Some of the rules violeted sepoys religious beliefs and
				sensibilities.</li>
			<li>Many people believed that if they cross sea they would lose their
				religion and caste. So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to
				burma by the sea route to fight for the compnay, they refused to
				follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route.</li>
			<li>The sepoys who disobeyed were severely punished.</li>
			<li>In 1856 the company passed a new law which stated that every new
				person who took up employment in the company's army had to agree
				to serve overseas if required.</li>
			<li>Sepoys reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of
				them were peasants and had families living in the villages. So the
				anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys.
				</li>
