		</ul>
		<div class="section">
		<p class="pbold">Some facts that helps in understanding the mechanism of
			monsoon-</p>
		<p>
			<span class="pbold">1)</span><span> THE DIFFERENTIAL HEATING AND
			COOLING OF LAND AND WATER</span> creates low pressure on landmass
			of india, while seas experience comparativerly high pressure.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="pbold">2)</span><span> THE SHIFT OF THE POSITION OF INTER
			TROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE (ITCZ)</span> in summer, over the ganga
			plain. <span>ITCZ</span> is the equatorial trough normally positioned
			about 5 degree north of the equator. It is also known as monsoon-
			trough during the monsoon season.
		</p>
		<div class="box">
		<p class="box-heading">ITCZ:</p>
			<p>
				The inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is a broad trough of
				low pressure in equatorial latitudes. This is where the northeast
				and the southeast trade winds converge. This convergence zone
				lies more or less parallel to the equator but moves north or
				south with the apparent movement of the sun.

		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="pbold">4)</span> The <span>TIBETIAN PLATEAU GETS

		<h3>Southern Oscillation(SO)</h3>
		<ul class="ul-content">
			<li>The periodic change in pressure conditions in tropical eastern
				south pacific ocean and tropical eastern indian ocean is termed
				as southern oscillation.</li>
			<li>Normally when tropical eastern south pacific ocean experiences
				high pressure, the tropical eastern indian ocean experiences low
				pressure.</li>
			<li>But in some years the pressure conditions reverse, the eastern
				pacific ocean experience low pressure.</li>
			<li>The pressure difference between <span>Tahiti</span>
				<span class="libold">(pacific ocean 18 degree south/ 149 degree
				west)</span> and <span>Darwin</span> in northern australia 	
				<span class="libold">(indian ocean 12 degree 30 minute south/ 131 
				degree east)</span> is computed to predict the intensity of the
				monsoons.</li>
			<li>If pressure difference is negetive, it would mean below average
				and late monsoons.</li>
			<hr>
			<li><span>El nino</span>- It is a phenomenon in which a warm ocean
				current flows past the peruvian coast in place of cold peruvian
				current in every 2 to 5 year.</li>
			<li>The change in pressure differences in SO is connected to el nino.
				Hence the phenomenon is refered to as <span>ENSO</span> <span

		<p class="box-heading">El Nino:</p>
			<p>
				This name is given to the periodic developement of a warm ocean
				current along the coast of peru as a temporary replacement of the
				cold peruvian current. The word <span>"El Nino"</span> is a
				spanish word meaning <span class="pbold">"the child"</span>, and

		<ul class="ul-content">
			<li>Duration= mid novemer to february.</li>

			<li>Temperature decreases from south to north.</li>
			<li>South temperature 24-25 degree.</li>
			<li>North temperature 10-15 degree.</li>
			<li>Flow of northeast trade wind form land to sea, making it a dry

			<li>High pressure area over north india.</li>
			<li>Clear sky, low temperature, low humidity.</li>
			<li>Inflow to cyclonic disturbances that originate over mediterranean

				importance for cultivation of rabi crop.</li>
			<li>A little rain in tamil nadu coast due to flow of wind from sea to
				land.</li>
			<li>Peninsular region hardly have any noticeable seasonal change in

		<h3><span class="num">2)</span>Hot weather season (summmer)</h3>
		<ul class="ul-content">
			<li>Duration= march to may.</li>
			<li>Due to northward movement of sun, global heat belt shifts
				northwards.</li>
			<li>Temperature gradually increases from month of march to may.</li>
			<li>In may temperature of 45 degree celsius is common in northwestern
				parts.</li>
			<li>As temperature increases in northern part, air pressure fall
				drastically and create low pressure area extending from thar

				Circulation of air set in around this trough.</li>
			<li>A duststorm naming "loo" blow during day over north and

			<li>Loo are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds. They commonly blow in

		<h3><span class="num">3)</span>Advancing monsoon (rain)</h3>
		<ul class="ul-content">
			<li>Low pressure area over northern plains attractss trade winds from

			<li>The windward side of western ghats receive about 250 cm of

				rainfall in the world.</li>
			<li>Rainfall in ganga valley decreases from west to east. Rajasthan
				and parts of gujurat get scanty rainfall.</li>
			<li>With time, the monsoon trough and its axis moves nortward and
				southward. It determines the rainfall on a area.</li>
			<li>Monsoon conisists of a tendency to have "breaks" in rainfall. A
				continuous rainfall is followed by rainless period and again a
				period of rainfall. The discontinuous is related to movement in
				monsoon trough.</li>
			<li>When the axis of the monsoon through lies over the plains,
				rainfall is good in these parts. And when the axis moves to
				himalays, the plains remains dry.</li>
			<li>When trough moves to himalays, it makes high downpour in
				himalayan river areas. This rain brings devastating floods which
				cause damage to life and properties in plains.</li>
			<li>The frequency and intensity of tropical depressions too determine
				the amount and duration of monsoon rains. These depressions form
				at the head of the bay of bengal and crosses over to the mainland.
				</li>
			<li>The depressions follow the axis of the "monsoon trough of low
				pressure".</li>
			<li>Monsoon in very uncertain in nature. The duration of dry day and
				rainfall day is uncertain and irregular throughout the country.
				It is irregular in its day of arrival and retreat. The
