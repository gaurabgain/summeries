CHAPTER=4)CLIMATE
=================================================================================

Climate- It refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a
large area for a long period of time (more than 30 years).

Weather- It refers to the state of atmosphere over an area at any point of time.


Elements of climate-
-------------------
1)Temperature
2)Atmospheric pressure
3)Wind
4)Humidity
5)Precipitation


> The world is divided into number of climatic regions.
> The climate of india is "monsoon" type.
> Despite having monsoon type climate, india has significant regional variations
  in climatic conditions within the country.
> Regional variation consists of high temperature in desert area of rajasthan, 
  vary low temperatue in himalayas in J&K, very high precipitation in north-east
  regions of india etc.
________________________________________________________________________________
|> The word monsoon is derived from the arabic word "mausim" which means season.|
|> Monsoon refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year. |

CLIMATIC CONTROLS
=================

There are six major climate controls of any place.
1) Latitude
2) Altitude
3) Pressure and wind system
4) Distance from sea(continentality)
5) Ocean currents
6) Relief features

==> Latitude-
>Due to curvature of earth, it receives more and direct sunlight.
>Temperature gradually decreases from equator towards pole.

==> Altitude-
> With increasing altitude, atomosphere becomes less dense and temperature
  decreases.
> The hills situated in higher altitude are therefore cooler than surfaces at
  low altitude.

==> Pressure and Wind system-
> Pressure and wind system of any area depend upon latitude and longitude of a
  place.
> It influence temperatue and rainfall pattern of the place.

==> Distance from sea (continentality)-
> At coast the temperature is controlled compared to inland due to phenomenon of
  land breeze/sea breeze.
> As the distance from sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and 
  people experience extreme weather(very hot in summer, very cold in winter).
  This condition is known as continentality.

==> Ocean currents-
> Climate of coastal area is affected by ocean currents with onshore winds.
> If winds are onshore, hot or cold current will make the area hot or cold.

==> Relief features-
> High mountains act as barriers for hot or cold wind.
> If mountains are high enough they may block rain-bearing wind which can cause
  precipitation in any area.
> The other side of mountain (leeward side) remain relatively dry.


FACTORS AFFECTING INDIA'S CLIMATE
=================================

Latitude-
--------
> The tropic of cancer passes through middle of the country from rann of kuchchh
  in west to mizoram in east. Dividing the country in almost in half.
> The lower half, south to tropic of cancer, belongs to tropical area.
> The upper half, north to tropic of cancer, belongs to sub-tropics.
> India has both tropical and sub-tropical climate.

Altitude-
-------
> The himalayn mountains in north have average altitude of 6000 meters, the coast
  have altitude of about 30 meters.
> Himalayas pervent cold winds from central asia from entering the subcontinent.
> Due to mountains indian subcontinent experience milder winter compared to
  central asia.

Pressure and winds-
------------------
The atomospheric conditions that govern india's climate-
1) Pressure and surface winds
2) Upper air circulation
3) Western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones

Pressure and surface winds-
-------------------------
> India lies in region of north easterly winds, which originate form subtropical
  high-pressure belt of northern hemisphere.
> They flow southwards towards equator and get deflected to right due to coriolis
  force.
> North easterly winds carry very little moisture.

> In winter, wind flows from north to south from north himalays to ocenans in
  south. High pressure is developed over areas  north of himalayas and low
  pressure is developed over oceans.
> In summer, wind flow from south to north from ocean in south to indian
  subcontinent in north. Low pressure is developed over interior asia and also
  over northwestern india and high pressure over oceans in south.

> The wind in summer moves from area over south of indian ocean in south-easterly
  direction. It crosses the equator and turns right over indian subcontinent.
> These winds are known as "southwest monsoon winds". They carry moisture when
  they flow over ocean and bring rain to mainland of india.

|CORIOLIS FORCE:                                                               | 
|---------------                                                               |
|> An aparent force caused by earth's rotation.                                | 
|> It is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in northern        |
|  hemisphere and towrds left in southern hemisphere.                          |
|> It is also known as "Ferrel's law".                                         |
|______________________________________________________________________________|

Upper air circulation-
----------------------
> Upper air circulation on india's region is dominated by westerly flow, a major
  component of this flow is jet stream.
> Jet stream over india is located at approximately over 27-30 degree north.
> Due to their location, it is known as subtropical westerly jet streams.
> On india, westerly jet stream flow over south of himalayas throughout the year
  except in summer.
> In summer, the westerly jet stream moves north of himalayas. An easterly jet
  stream, called as sub-tropical easterly jet stream flows over peninsular india
  at 14 degree north.
> Westerly jet stream bring western cyclonic disturbances.
_______________________________________________________________________________
|JET STREAM:                                                                   |
|-----------                                                                   |
|> A narrow belt of high altitude westerly wind in troposphere.                |
|> They have speed of about 110km/h in summer and 184km/h in winter.           |
|______________________________________________________________________________|

Western cyclonic disturbances-
------------------------------
> This is a weather phenomena, occur in winter months brought by westerly flow.
> Influence weather of north and north-western region of india.
> It creates tropical cyclone, during monsoon.
> Tropical cyclone during october-november are part of easterly flow, it mainly 
  affects coastal regions of odisha and andhra pradesh.


THE INDIAN MONSOON
==================
> Monsoon have strong influence over indian climate.
> Sailors who came to india in ancient times have observed the reversal wind.
> Arabs named this seasonal reveral wind as "monsoon".
> Area of influence = 20 degree north t0 20 degree south.


Some facts that helps to understand the mechanism of monsoon-

1)THE DIFFERENTIAL HEATING AND COOLING OF LAND AND WATER creates low pressure on
landmass of india, while seas experience comparativerly high pressure.

2)THE SHIFT OF THE POSITION OF INTER TROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE (ITCZ) in summer,
over the ganga plain. ITCZ is the equatorial trough normally positioned about
5 degree north of the equator. It is also known as monsoon-trough during the
monsoon season.

 _______________________________________________________________________________
|ITCZ-                                                                          |
|----                                                                           |
|The inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is a broad trough of low pressure   |
|in equatorial latitudes. This is where the northeast and the southeast trade   |
|winds converge. This convergence zone lies more or less parallel to the equator|
|but moves north or south with the apparent movement of the sun.                |
|_______________________________________________________________________________|


3)The presence of HIGH-PRESSURE AREA, EAST OF MADAGASCAR, approximately at 20
degree south over the indian ocean. The intensity and position of this high
pressure area affects the indian monsoon.

4)The TIBETIAN PLATEAU GETS INTENSELY HEATED during summer, which results in
strong vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over the plateau
at about 9km above sea level.

5)The MOVEMENT OF THE WESTERLY JET STREAM TO THE NORTH OF THE HIMALAYAS and the
presence of the TROPICAL EASTERLY JET STREAM OVER THE INDIAN PENINSULA during
summer.

Southern Oscillation(SO)-
-----------------------
> The periodic change in pressure conditions in tropical eastern south pacific
  ocean and tropical eastern indian ocean is termed as southern oscillation.
> Normally when tropical eastern south pacific ocean experiences high pressure,
  the tropical eastern indian ocean experiences low pressure.
> But in some years the pressure conditions reverse, the eastern pacific ocean
  experience low pressure.
> The pressure difference between Tahiti (pacific ocean 18 degree south/ 149 
  degree west) and darwin in northern australia (indian ocean 12 degree 30 minute
  south/ 131 degree east) is computed to predict the intensity of the monsoons.
> If pressure difference is negetive, it would mean below average and late
  monsoons.

> El nino- It is a phenomenon in which a warm ocean current flows past the
  peruvian coast in place of cold peruvian current in every 2 to 5 year.
> The change in pressure differences in SO is connected to el nino. Hence the
  phenomenon is refered to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations).

|El Nino:                                                                       |
|-------                                                                        |
|This name is given to the periodic developement of a warm ocean current along  |
|the coast of peru as a temporary replacement of the cold peruvian current. The |
|word "El Nino" is a spanish word meaning "the child", and refers to the baby   |
|christ, as this current starts flowing during christmas.                       |

THE ONSET OF THE MONSOON AND WITHDRAWAL
======================================
> Monsoon duration= 100-120 days, early june to mid september.

Onset(mainland)-
> At arival of monsoon, rainfall suddenly increases as compared to pre monsoon.
  The rainfall continues to increase for several days. It is known as burst of
  monsoon.
> At arival at southern tip of india, it proceeds into two- the arabian sea
  branch and the bay of bengal branch.

arival paths-
> 1st week of june = southern tip of indian peninsula;
> within 1st week of june = assam,rapid advance,defelct west towards ganga plain;
> 10th june = arabian branch, mumbai, rapid advance;
> mid-june  = arabian branch, saurashtra-kuchchh and central part of country;

> merger of arabian and bay of bengal branch at northwest part of ganga plain;
> end of june = bay of bengal branch , delhi;
> 1st week of july = wester UP, punjab, haryana, east rajasthan;
> mid july = himachal pradesh and rest of country;

withdrawl or retreat(mainland)-
> early september= begining of withdrawl from north-west states of india;
> mid october= complete withdrawl from northen half;
> rapid withdrawl at southern half.
> early december = complete withdrawl

onset (islands)-
> 1st week of april - 1st week of may;

withdrawl (islands)-
> 1st week of december - 1st week of january;


THE SEASONS
===========
> India have four main seasons. They are cold weather season,hot weather season,
  advancing monsoon,retreating monsoon.


1)Cold weather season (winter)-
-------------------------------
> Duration= mid novemer to february.
> December and January are the coldest months, in norhern india.
> Temperature decreases from south to north.
> South temperature 24-25 degree.
> North temperature 10-15 degree.
> Flow of northeast trade wind form land to sea, making it a dry season.
> Over ganga plain , influenced by relief, winds blow through ganga valley from
  west and northwest.
> High pressure area over north india.
> Clear sky, low temperature, low humidity.
> Inflow to cyclonic disturbances that originate over mediterranean sea. It move
  into india along with westerly flow. It causes small winter rainfall, locally
  known as "mahawat" . It have immense importance for cultivation of rabi crop.
> A little rain in tamil nadu coast due to flow of wind from sea to land.
> Peninsular region hardly have any noticeable seasonal change in temperature due
  to moderating influence of sea. Due to this the peninsular region does not have
  a well defined cold season.


2)Hot weather season (summmer)-
-------------------------------

3)Advancing monsoon (rain)-
---------------------------

4)Retreating/Post monsoons (transition season)-
-----------------------------------------------
