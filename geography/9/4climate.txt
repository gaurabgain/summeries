CHAPTER=4)CLIMATE
=================================================================================

Climate- It refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a
large area for a long period of time (more than 30 years).

Weather- It refers to the state of atmosphere over an area at any point of time.


Elements of climate-
-------------------
1)Temperature
2)Atmospheric pressure
3)Wind
4)Humidity
5)Precipitation


> The world is divided into number of climatic regions.
> The climate of india is "monsoon" type.
> Despite having monsoon type climate, india has significant regional variations
  in climatic conditions within the country.
> Regional variation consists of high temperature in desert area of rajasthan, 
  vary low temperatue in himalayas in J&K, very high precipitation in north-east
  regions of india etc.
________________________________________________________________________________
|> The word monsoon is derived from the arabic word "mausim" which means season.|
|> Monsoon refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year. |

CLIMATIC CONTROLS
=================

There are six major climate controls of any place.
1) Latitude
2) Altitude
3) Pressure and wind system
4) Distance from sea(continentality)
5) Ocean currents
6) Relief features

==> Latitude-
>Due to curvature of earth, it receives more and direct sunlight.
>Temperature gradually decreases from equator towards pole.

==> Altitude-
> With increasing altitude, atomosphere becomes less dense and temperature
  decreases.
> The hills situated in higher altitude are therefore cooler than surfaces at
  low altitude.

==> Pressure and Wind system-
> Pressure and wind system of any area depend upon latitude and longitude of a
  place.
> It influence temperatue and rainfall pattern of the place.

==> Distance from sea (continentality)-
> At coast the temperature is controlled compared to inland due to phenomenon of
  land breeze/sea breeze.
> As the distance from sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and 
  people experience extreme weather(very hot in summer, very cold in winter).
  This condition is known as continentality.

==> Ocean currents-
> Climate of coastal area is affected by ocean currents with onshore winds.
> If winds are onshore, hot or cold current will make the area hot or cold.

==> Relief features-
> High mountains act as barriers for hot or cold wind.
> If mountains are high enough they may block rain-bearing wind which can cause
  precipitation in any area.
> The other side of mountain (leeward side) remain relatively dry.


FACTORS AFFECTING INDIA'S CLIMATE
=================================

Latitude-
--------
> The tropic of cancer passes through middle of the country from rann of kuchchh
  in west to mizoram in east. Dividing the country in almost in half.
> The lower half, south to tropic of cancer, belongs to tropical area.
> The upper half, north to tropic of cancer, belongs to sub-tropics.
> India has both tropical and sub-tropical climate.

Altitude-
-------
> The himalayn mountains in north have average altitude of 6000 meters, the coast
  have altitude of about 30 meters.
> Himalayas pervent cold winds from central asia from entering the subcontinent.
> Due to mountains indian subcontinent experience milder winter compared to
  central asia.

Pressure and winds-
------------------
The atomospheric conditions that govern india's climate-
1) Pressure and surface winds
2) Upper air circulation
3) Western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones

Pressure and surface winds-
-------------------------
> India lies in region of north easterly winds, which originate form subtropical
  high-pressure belt of northern hemisphere.
> They flow southwards towards equator and get deflected to right due to coriolis
  force.
> North easterly winds carry very little moisture.

> In winter, wind flows from north to south from north himalays to ocenans in
  south. High pressure is developed over areas  north of himalayas and low
  pressure is developed over oceans.
> In summer, wind flow from south to north from ocean in south to indian
  subcontinent in north. Low pressure is developed over interior asia and also
  over northwestern india and high pressure over oceans in south.

> The wind in summer moves from area over south of indian ocean in south-easterly
  direction. It crosses the equator and turns right over indian subcontinent.
> These winds are known as "southwest monsoon winds". They carry moisture when
  they flow over ocean and bring rain to mainland of india.

|CORIOLIS FORCE:                                                               | 
|---------------                                                               |
|> An aparent force caused by earth's rotation.                                | 
|> It is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in northern        |
|  hemisphere and towrds left in southern hemisphere.                          |
|> It is also known as "Ferrel's law".                                         |
|______________________________________________________________________________|

Upper air circulation-
----------------------
> Upper air circulation on india's region is dominated by westerly flow, a major
  component of this flow is jet stream.
> Jet stream over india is located at approximately over 27-30 degree north.
> Due to their location, it is known as subtropical westerly jet streams.
> On india, westerly jet stream flow over south of himalayas throughout the year
  except in summer.
> In summer, the westerly jet stream moves north of himalayas. An easterly jet
  stream, called as sub-tropical easterly jet stream flows over peninsular india
  at 14 degree north.
> Westerly jet stream bring western cyclonic disturbances.

|JET STREAM:                                                                   |
|-----------                                                                   |
|> A narrow belt of high altitude westerly wind in troposphere.                |
|> They have speed of about 110km/h in summer and 184km/h in winter.           |
|______________________________________________________________________________|

Western cyclonic disturbances-
------------------------------
> This is a weather phenomena, occur in winter months brought by westerly flow.
> Influence weather of north and north-western region of india.
> It creates tropical cyclone, during monsoon.
> Tropical cyclone during october-november are part of easterly flow, it mainly 
  affects coastal regions of odisha and andhra pradesh.
