CHAPTER=4)CLIMATE
=================================================================================

Climate- It refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a
large area for a long period of time (more than 30 years).

Weather- It refers to the state of atmosphere over an area at any point of time.


Elements of climate-
-------------------
1)Temperature
2)Atmospheric pressure
3)Wind
4)Humidity
5)Precipitation


> The world is divided into number of climatic regions.
> The climate of india is "monsoon" type.
> Despite having monsoon type climate, india has significant regional variations
  in climatic conditions within the country.
> Regional variation consists of high temperature in desert area of rajasthan, 
  vary low temperatue in himalayas in J&K, very high precipitation in north-east
  regions of india etc.
________________________________________________________________________________
|> The word monsoon is derived from the arabic word "mausim" which means season.|
|> Monsoon refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year. |

CLIMATIC CONTROLS
=================

There are six major climate controls of any place.
1) Latitude
2) Altitude
3) Pressure and wind system
4) Distance from sea(continentality)
5) Ocean currents
6) Relief features

==> Latitude-
>Due to curvature of earth, it receives more and direct sunlight.
>Temperature gradually decreases from equator towards pole.

==> Altitude-
> With increasing altitude, atomosphere becomes less dense and temperature
  decreases.
> The hills situated in higher altitude are therefore cooler than surfaces at
  low altitude.

==> Pressure and Wind system-
> Pressure and wind system of any area depend upon latitude and longitude of a
  place.
> It influence temperatue and rainfall pattern of the place.

==> Distance from sea (continentality)-
> At coast the temperature is controlled compared to inland due to phenomenon of
  land breeze/sea breeze.
> As the distance from sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and 
  people experience extreme weather(very hot in summer, very cold in winter).
  This condition is known as continentality.

==> Ocean currents-
> Climate of coastal area is affected by ocean currents with onshore winds.
> If winds are onshore, hot or cold current will make the area hot or cold.

==> Relief features-
> High mountains act as barriers for hot or cold wind.
> If mountains are high enough they may block rain-bearing wind which can cause
  precipitation in any area.
> The other side of mountain (leeward side) remain relatively dry.
