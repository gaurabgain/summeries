POLICIES AND THE PEOPLE
=======================

Nawabs lose their power-
-----------------------
> Since mid-eighteenth century, the power of nawabs and rajas started decreasing,
  due to various policies by east indian company.
> Stage by stage the power of rulers, their revenue,territoies,military are taken
  away by company.
> Rulers tried to negotiate with company,to protect their power. But the company,
  was confident on its superiority and turned down their requests.
> Rani laxmibai of jhansi wanted the company to recognise her adopted son as the
  heir to the kingdom after death of her husband.
> In 1801, subsidiary alliance was imposed over awadh, and in 1856 it was taken
  over.
> Governer-general dalhousie declared that awadh territory was misgoverned and
  british rule was needed to ensure proper administration.
> Company wanted to end mughal dynasty. In 1849, dalhousie announced that after
  death of bahadur shah zafar, the family of king would be shifted out of the
  red fort and given another place in delhi to reside in.
> In 1856, governer-general canning decided that bahadur shah zafar would be the
  last mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be
  recognised as kings. Instead they would just be called princes.

The peasants and the sepoys-
---------------------------
> In the coutryside peasants and zamindars are didn't liked the high taxes and
  the rigid methods of revenue collection.
> Many lost the lands they had tilled for generations.
> Indian sepoys in the employ of the company were unhappy about their pay,
  allowances and conditions of service.
> Some of the rules violeted sepoys religious beliefs and sensibilities.
> Many people believed that if they cross sea they would lose their religion and
  caste. So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to burma by the sea route to
  fight for the compnay, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to
  go by the land route.
> The sepoys who disobeyed were severely punished.
> In 1856 the company passed a new law which stated that every new person who
  took up employment in the company's army had to agree to serve overseas if
  required.
> Sepoys reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were
  peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants
  quickly spread among the sepoys.

Responses to reforms-
--------------------
> The british believed indian soicety need to be reformed. So they passed various
  reforms which were no very welcomed by indians.
> To stop practice of sati and to encourage remarriage of widows, various laws
  were passed.
> English language education was promoted actively.
> After 1830, company allowed christian missionaries to function freely and even
  own land and property.
> 1850 - new laws were passed make conversion to christianity easier. It allowed
  an indian who had converted to christianity to inherit the property of his
  ancestors.

  their social customs and their traditional way of life.

|-----------------------------                                                  |
|Excerpts from the book "Majha Pravas", written by Vishubhatt Godse, a brahman  |
|from a village in maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna  |
|being organised in mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the|
|journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in theree days . The |
|sepoys said:                                                                   |
|  the english were determinded to wipe out the religions of the hindus and the |
|  muslims.. they had made a list of eighty-four rules as announced these in a  |
|  gathering of all big kings and princes in calcutta. They said that the kings |
|  refused to accept these rules and warned the english of dire consequences and|
|  massive upheaval if these are implemented.. that the kings all returned to   |
|  their capitals in great anger .. all the big people began making plans. A    |
|  date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been          |
|  circulated from the cantonment in meerut by letters sent to different        |
|  cantonments.                                                                 |

|Another account we have from those days are the memories of subedar sitaram    |
|pande. Sitaram pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the bengal native     |
|army. He served the english for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the    |
|british to suppress the rebelion though his own son was a rebel and was killed |
|by the british in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his     |
|commanding officer,Noragte, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in  |
|1861 in awadhi and norgate translated it into english and had it published     |
|under the title "From sepoy to subedar".                                       |
|Here is an excerpt from what sitaram pande wrote:                              |
|  It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the    |
|  sepoys with distrust and led thim to plot against the Government. Agents     |
|  of the nawab of oudh and also of the king of delhi were sent all over india  |
|  to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, |
|  telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king.|
|  They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to     |
|  mutiny and turn against their masters, the english, with the object of       |
|  restoring the emperor of delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was  |
|  wholly within the army's powers if the soldiers would only act together and  |
|  do as they were advised.                                                     |
|  It chanced that about this time the sarkar sent parties of men from each     |
|  regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle.|
|  These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by  |
|  some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were  |
|  greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to    |
|  others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement|
|  in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years' service nothing |
|  had ever been done by the sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have     |
|  already mentioned the sepoys' minds had been inflamed by the seizure of oudh.|
|  Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the english |
|  was to turn us all into christians, and they had therefore introduced the    |
|  cartridge in order to bring this about, since both mahommedans and hindus    |
|  would be defiled by using it.                                                |
|  The colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could|
|  not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me|
|  to go to my home.                                                            |
|                                                                               |
