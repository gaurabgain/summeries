  due to various policies by east indian company.
> Stage by stage the power of rulers, their revenue,territoies,military are taken
  away by company.
> Rulers tried to negotiate with company,to protect their power. But the company,
  was confident on its superiority and turned down their requests.
> Rani laxmibai of jhansi wanted the company to recognise her adopted son as the
  heir to the kingdom after death of her husband.
> In 1801, subsidiary alliance was imposed over awadh, and in 1856 it was taken
  over.
> Governer-general dalhousie declared that awadh territory was misgoverned and
  british rule was needed to ensure proper administration.
> Company wanted to end mughal dynasty. In 1849, dalhousie announced that after
  death of bahadur shah zafar, the family of king would be shifted out of the
  red fort and given another place in delhi to reside in.
> In 1856, governer-general canning decided that bahadur shah zafar would be the
  last mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be
  recognised as kings. Instead they would just be called princes.

The peasants and the sepoys-
---------------------------
> In the coutryside peasants and zamindars are didn't liked the high taxes and
  the rigid methods of revenue collection.
> Many lost the lands they had tilled for generations.
> Indian sepoys in the employ of the company were unhappy about their pay,
  allowances and conditions of service.
> Some of the rules violeted sepoys religious beliefs and sensibilities.
> Many people believed that if they cross sea they would lose their religion and
  caste. So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to burma by the sea route to
  fight for the compnay, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to
  go by the land route.
> The sepoys who disobeyed were severely punished.
> In 1856 the company passed a new law which stated that every new person who
  took up employment in the company's army had to agree to serve overseas if
  required.
> Sepoys reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were
  peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants
  quickly spread among the sepoys.
