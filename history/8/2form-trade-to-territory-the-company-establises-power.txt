East india company got a charter from queen elizabeth 1 which gave it a exclusive 
right to trade with east. With these power it purchased cheap goods and sold them
expensive in europe.

european powers such as french,portuguese,dutch etc also had a presence in east.

trading posts and trade is guarded with weapons

East india company in bengal-
-----------------------------
In 1651 first english factory was set up at banks of hugli river. As merchants are
started settling near english factory for good trade, by 1696 british started
building fort around the factory.

Shortly after, british got zamindari rights over three villages by bribing mughal
officials. Kalikata was one of those villages, which later grew into city Calcutta.

Aurangzeb issued a farman granting only the company the right to trade duty free. 
British missused this privilage. Officials of the company doing business on the side
were expected to pay duty, which they refused, causing loss of revenue for mughals.

After death of aurangzed, the bengal nawabs asserted thier power. Murshid Quli Khan
followed by Alivardi Khan then Sirajuddaulah were the nawabs of bengal. They were
strong rulers, and opposed many of the company's wrong practices. These conflicts
led to battle of plassey.

After death of alivardi khan, sirajuddaulah became nawab. Worried company officials
tried to put a puppet ruler in place of the nawab. Sirajuddaulah demanded not to
interfere in political affairs, stop factory fortification and pay the revenues.
