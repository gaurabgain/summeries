====================================================================================

SHORT SUMMERY
=============
East india company got a charter from queen elizabeth 1 which gave it a exclusive 
right to trade with east. With these power it purchased cheap goods and sold them
expensive in europe.

However the royal charter is can not be appllied on other european powers. Other 
european powers such as french,portuguese,dutch etc also had a presence in east.
That led to competion,battle,blockade of ships between them. Companies made fortified
trading posts and trade is guarded with weapons

East india company in bengal-
-----------------------------
In 1651 first english factory was set up at banks of hugli river. As merchants are
started settling near english factory for good trade, by 1696 british started
building fort around the factory.

Shortly after, british got zamindari rights over three villages by bribing mughal
officials. Kalikata was one of those villages, which later grew into city Calcutta.

Aurangzeb issued a farman granting only the company the right to trade duty free. 
British missused this privilage. Officials of the company doing business on the side
were expected to pay duty, which they refused, causing loss of revenue for mughals.

Trade to battles
----------------
After death of aurangzed, the bengal nawabs asserted thier power. Murshid Quli Khan
followed by Alivardi Khan then Sirajuddaulah were the nawabs of bengal. They were
strong rulers, and opposed many of the company's wrong practices. These conflicts
led to battle of plassey.

Battle of plassey-
-----------------
After death of alivardi khan, sirajuddaulah became nawab. Worried company officials
tried to put a puppet ruler in place of the nawab. Sirajuddaulah demanded not to
interfere in political affairs, stop factory fortification and pay the revenues.

After failed negotiations, nawab attacked factory with 30000 soldiers at kassimbazar
captured officals,warehouse and blockaded english ships. Then captured company fort
at calcutta.

After defeat at calcutta, british send solders from madras under command of robert
clive. After failure of prolonged neotiations with nawab, in 1757 robert clive led
company's army against nawab at plassey. Company's army got victory and sirajuddaulah
got assasinated.

The battle of plassey became the first major victory of company won in india. After
victory the company put a puppet ruler named Mir Jafar in place of Sirajuddaulah.
Mir jafar was one of the commanders of sirajuddaulah. Robert clive won his support
by promising to make him nawab after crushing sirajuddaulah. In exchange the force
led by mir jafar didnot fought the battle. This one of the main reasons for the 
defeat of sirajuddaulah.
