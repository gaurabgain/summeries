CHAPTER=2)FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY- THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES POWER
====================================================================================

SHORT SUMMERY
=============
East india company got a charter from queen elizabeth 1 which gave it a exclusive 
right to trade with east. With these power it purchased cheap goods and sold them
expensive in europe.

However the royal charter is can not be appllied on other european powers. Other 
european powers such as french,portuguese,dutch etc also had a presence in east.
That led to competion,battle,blockade of ships between them. Companies made fortified
trading posts and trade is guarded with weapons

East india company in bengal-
-----------------------------
In 1651 first english factory was set up at banks of hugli river. As merchants are
started settling near english factory for good trade, by 1696 british started
building fort around the factory.

Shortly after, british got zamindari rights over three villages by bribing mughal
officials. Kalikata was one of those villages, which later grew into city Calcutta.

Aurangzeb issued a farman granting only the company the right to trade duty free. 
British missused this privilage. Officials of the company doing business on the side
were expected to pay duty, which they refused, causing loss of revenue for mughals.

Trade to battles
----------------
After death of aurangzed, the bengal nawabs asserted thier power. Murshid Quli Khan
followed by Alivardi Khan then Sirajuddaulah were the nawabs of bengal. They were
strong rulers, and opposed many of the company's wrong practices. These conflicts
led to battle of plassey.

Battle of plassey(1757)-
------------------------
After death of alivardi khan, sirajuddaulah became nawab. Worried company officials
tried to put a puppet ruler in place of the nawab. Sirajuddaulah demanded not to
interfere in political affairs, stop factory fortification and pay the revenues.

After failed negotiations, nawab attacked factory with 30000 soldiers at kassimbazar
captured officals,warehouse and blockaded english ships. Then captured company fort
at calcutta.

After defeat at calcutta, british send solders from madras under command of robert
clive. After failure of prolonged neotiations with nawab, in 1757 robert clive led
company's army against nawab at plassey. Company's army got victory and sirajuddaulah
got assasinated.

The battle of plassey became the first major victory of company won in india. After
victory the company put a puppet ruler named Mir Jafar in place of Sirajuddaulah.
Mir jafar was one of the commanders of sirajuddaulah. Robert clive won his support
by promising to make him nawab after crushing sirajuddaulah. In exchange, the force
led by mir jafar didnot fought the battle. This was one of the main reasons for the 
defeat of sirajuddaulah.

Battle of buxar(1764)-
----------------------
Puppet rulers were not always cooperative to the company because they also have to 
maintain basic dignity and sovereignty to get get respect from their subjects.
Mir jafar protested, company put another puppet in place of him named Mir qasim.
When Mir qasim protested, he was defeated by Mir jafar with the help of company, in
battle of buxar.

Diwan of provinces of Bengal-
---------------------------
After death of Mir jaffar in 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the company as the 
Diwan of provices of bengal. It allowed the company to use the revenue resources of
bengal. The revenues were so vast that it could finance company expenses like
purchase of goods, maintenance of troops, fortification of company factories.

Due to huge revenue, the company didn't need to import gold and silver from britain
for its trade. The revenue covered all the expenses.

Company ofiicials became NABOBS-
-------------------------------
Nabob is an anglicised term of the word nawab. After battle of buxar company officals
earned huge amounts of money and property. Although many officials died early deaths
due to war or diseases, those who managed to return to Britain with wealth, lived a 
comfortable life in britain. They led flashy lives and flauted their riches. They
were seen as social climbers in british society and ridiculed in plays and cartoons.


COMPANY RULE EXPANDS
===================
The tactic that company used to annex indian kingdoms was various political,economic
and diplomatic methords. Company appointed its workers in various indian states.
The workers were political or commmercial agents and their job was to propagate the
interests of the company. Using workers company interfered in internal affairs in 
indian states, deciding the successors of the states etc.

Subsidiary alliance-
--------------------
Under this alliance indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent army and
they ware to be protected by the army of the company. In exchenge of protection they
have to pay money to the company. If a ruler was failed to pay the expense, then part
of their territory was taken by company as penalty.

Tipu Sultan - The "Tiger of Mysore"-
------------------------------------
Mysore was a powerful state under leadership of Haider Ali (ruled 1761-1782) and his
son Tipu Sultan (ruled 1782-1799). Profitable malabar coast was under Mysore where in
1785 Tipu sultan stopped the export of sandalwood,pepper and cardamom and not allowed
local merchants to trade with company.

Tipu had close relationship with french, due to which british fought 4 wars with
mysore (1767-69, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799) and won the last war- the battle of
Seringapatam. In the last war tipu died defending his capital seringapatam. After his
death, Mysore was placed under the ruling dynasty of Wodeyars and subsidiary alliance
was imposed on the state.

War with the Marathas-
---------------------
After Third Battle of Panipat, Maratha was divided into many states each under a
different chief. The chiefs are held together in a confederacy under a peshwa, who is
the military and administrative head.

First anglo-maratha war, ended in 1782 with treaty of Salbai, had no clear victor.
Second anglo-maratha war (1803-05), British gained orissa and territores of north of
yamuna including agra and delhi.
Third anglo-maratha war lost by marathas, peshwa was removed.

Claim to paramountcy-
---------------------
The policy of "paramonutcy" is intitiated under Lord Hastings. The company now
claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme. Hence its power was greater than
indian states. So to protect companys' interest it started annexing or threatning to
annex indian kingdoms.

It was challenged by queen of kittor, Rani Channamma. She led an anti-british 
resistance movement.She was arrested in 1824 and died in 1829. Rayanna, a chowkidar
of sangoli in kittor continued the resistance. He was caught in 1830 and hanged.

war in north-west-
-----------------
In late 1830s, company was worried about rising Russia. To take control of noth-west,
compnay fought war with afghanistan between 1838 and 1842. In 1843 they take over on
Sindh.In 1849,punjab was annexed.

The doctrine of lapse-
---------------------
This doctrine declared that if and indian ruler died without a male heir, his kingdom
would "lapse".This policy was given by Lord Dalhousie(governer general 1848-1856).

Kingdoms, such as Satara(1848), Sambalpur(1850), Udaipur(1852), Nagpur(1853), Jhansi
(1854) were annexed by applying this doctrine.


SETTING UP A NEW ADMINISTRATION
===============================
British territories were divided into administrative units called presidencies, and
there are 3 of them, bengal, madras and bombay. Each presidencies were ruled by
governers and the supreme head of administration was governer-general. The first
governer general of india was Warren Hastings.

A collector was the administative head of a district. The main job of collector was
to collect revenue and taxes and to maintain law and order in the district. The
office of the collector was called as The collectorate.

Each district was to have 2 courts, criminal court(faujdari adalat) and civil court
(diwani adalat). This system of justice started in 1772.

Hindu laws are compliled in 1775 and muslims laws are in 1778. Under the Regulating
Act of 1773, Supreme Court was established.

The company army-
----------------
The compnay army mostly composed of army of local kingdoms, consists of cavalry and
foot soldiers.
In early nineteenth century, british began to develope uniform military culture.
Soldiers were increasingly subjected to european style training. It consists of 
drills and made discipline among soldiers. This created problems because the cast
rules and feelings were ignored to build professional soldiers.

CONCLUSION
==========
East india company transformed from a trading company to a territorial power. Steam
technology helped british colonial ambition. Steamships reduced journey time, which
enabled more britishers and their family members to come to india.

By 1857, the company had direct rule over 78% of indian population and 63% of indian
territory. Company also had indirect influence on remaining places, thus virtually
controlled whole india.
