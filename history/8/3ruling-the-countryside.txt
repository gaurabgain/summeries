CHAPTER=3)RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE
================================================================================

THE COMPANY BECOMES THE DIWAN
=============================
On august 12 1765, the mughal emperor appointed the east india compnay as the
diwan of bengal. As diwan, the company became the chief financial administrator,
now it had to think of administration and collecting revenue. The collection of
revenue had to be done in such a way that it could meet the expenses of the
company.

Revenue for the company-
------------------------
Within five years of becoming diwan, the company bought double the amonut of
goods than earlier purchases. Earlier it had purchased goods in india by imported
gold and silver from britain. Now the revenue collected in bengal could finance
the puchase of goods for export.

Bengal famine-
-------------
As the company began purchasing cheap goods, the artisans were deserting villages
since they were being forced to sell their goods to the company at low price.
Peasants were unable to pay dues to the moneylenders. Due to  all those problems
agricultural production was collapsed heavily. This led to a famine in 1770 when
about ten million people, which was about one-third of the population of bengal 
was wiped out.

The need to improve agriculture-
-------------------------------
The company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the
settlement the rajas and talukdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked
to collect rent from peasants and pay the fixed revenue to the company. The 
revenue was fixed permanently, which means it will not increase. The company
officials thought that the revenue demand of the state would be fixed and the
zamindar would benefit from any increased production from the land.

Initial problem to zamindars-
----------------------------
The zamindars didn't invested in improving the land. The revenue that was fixed 
for the zamindars were unaffordable to zamindars. They lost their zamindari if
they failed to pay revenue. The company organised auctions to sold zamindari.

Loss of expected revenue to company in early 19th century-
----------------------------------------------------------
In early decade of 19th century, cutivation expanded and markets rose. This led
to increase in income of zamindar and no gain to the company. The company could
not demand more revenue, because it was fixed earlier.

Problem to the cultivator-
-------------------------
The cultivators found this system of fixed revenue extremely oppressive. The rent
that to be paid to zamindars were high and the cultivator had no securtiy over 
the land. To pay rent cultivator often take money from moneylender. If they fail
to return money to the moneylender, they were evicted from the land.

Mahalwari system-
----------------
Devised by Holt Mackenzie in 1822. Under this system the estimated revenue has to
be paid by the village(mahal). The charge of collecting revenue was given to the
village headman. The revenues were collected based on the measurements and
assessment from each of the plots within a village and the sum total ammonut was
to be paid to the company.

The munro system-
----------------
In munro system, the fields were surveyed separately and revenue assessment were
made directly with traditional cultivators. This system is was called ryotwari.
This system was applied on the south, some of the areas which were captured by 
the company after war with tipu sultan,because there were no tradional zamindars.


CROPS FOR EUROPE
===============
British realised india could grow crops that have market in Europe. They started
pursuading cultivators to produce other crops: jute in bengal, tea in assam,
sugarcane in united provices (uttar pradesh), wheat in punjab, cotton in 
maharastra and punjab, rice in madras.

Demand for indian indigo-
------------------------
Indigo plant grows primarily in tropics. Indian indigo was used as early as
thirteenth century in the european market, but it was expensive. Another plant
named woad was used to dye clother. Woad was cheap but produce pale dull colour.
Where as indigo produce rich blue color.

Indigo import was earlier banned in europe, however by seventeenth century,cloth
producers in europe persuaded governments to relax ban on indigo import. French
began cultivating indigo in St domingue in carribean, Portuguese in brazil,
English in Jamaica , Spanish in venezuela.

Indian indigo
-------------
British began production of indigo in bengal. In 1788 about 30% of indigo in
britain was imported form india, but by 1810, it had gone upto 95%. Many company
officials left thier job to look after their indigo business. Many english and
scottish came to india to become planters.

Indigo cultivation systems - nij cultivation-
---------------------------------------------
In nij cutltivation planter planted indigo in own land. The planter had full
control over the land. They then hire workers to produce indigo.

Problems with nij cultivation-
-----------------------------
Indigo production had to be done in large scale to remain profitable. Indigo
required fertile land to grow. Fertile land was scatterd. It required a large
workforce and equipments to grow indigo. All of those were challenging because
workers and equipments were being used in rice field at that same time.

Ryot cultivation of indigo-
--------------------------
Under ryoti cultivation planters force ryots to sign a contract. Those who signed
contract got cash from planters at low interest rates. Planters also provided
seed. The loan commited the ryots to cultivate indigo on atleast 25 percent of
land of their control. When crop was delivered to planter after harvest, a new
loan was given to the ryot.

Problems with ryot cultivation-
------------------------------
Ryots got new loan everytime from planters after delivering indigo. Peasants soon
realised that the price they got for the indigo was very low and the loan cycle
never ended. 
Planter insist peasants that indigo had to be cultivated on the most fertile land
which peasants prefer to cultivate rice. Indigo had deep roots and exhausted the
soil fertility rapildy, making the soil difficult to sow rice.


THE BLUE REBELLION AND AFTERMATH
================================
In march 1859 thousands of ryots refused to grow indigo. They refused to pay
rents to planters, those who worked for planters were socially boycotted. Ryots
attacked indigo factories with traditional weapons of that time, with spears,
swords, bow and arrows,  womens attacked with kitchen utensils.

Indigo ryots got support from local zamindars and villege headmen, because they
too felt oppressed working for planters. Some zamindars even went around villages
urging ryots to resist the planters.

After the news of revolt spread across many parts, the lieutenant governer toured
the region. In barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issed a notice stating ryots
would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts.

As the rebellion spread, the govenrnment brought military to protect planters 
from assult. Indigo Commission was set up to enquire into the system of indigo
production. The commission held planters guilty and criticised them for the 
coercive methords they used with indigo cultivators.

The commision declared that indigo cultivation was not profitable for ryots. The
ryots were asked to fulfil their exsisting contract and they can refuse to
produce indigo in future.

Aftermath
---------
The discovery of synthetic dyes in late nineteenth century the indigo business
was severely affected. After revolt in bengal, indigo production collapsed there.
The planters shifted their operation in bihar. Mahatma Gandhi's visit to
champaran in 1917 marked the beginning of the champaran movement against indigo
planters.
