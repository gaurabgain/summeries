CHAPTER=3)RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE
================================================================================

THE COMPANY BECOMES THE DIWAN
=============================
On august 12 1765, the mughal emperor appointed the east india compnay as the
diwan of bengal. As diwan, the company became the chief financial administrator,
now it had to think of administration and collecting revenue. The collection of
revenue had to be done in such a way that it could meet the expenses of the
company.

Revenue for the company-
------------------------
Within five years of becoming diwan, the company bought double the amonut of
goods than earlier purchases. Earlier it had purchased goods in india by imported
gold and silver from britain. Now the revenue collected in bengal could finance
the puchase of goods for export.

Bengal famine-
-------------
The company purchased cheap goods, the artisans were deserting villages since
they were being foreced to sell their goods to the company at low price. Peasants
were unable to pay dues. Due to  all those problems agricultural production was
collapsed heavily. This led to a famine in 1770 when about ten million people,
which is about one-third of the population was wiped out.

The need ot improve agriculture-
-------------------------------
The company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the
settlement the rajas and talukdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked
to collect rent from peasants and pay the fixed revenue to the company. The 
revenue was fixed permanently, which means it will not increase. The company 
officials thought that the revenue demand of the state would be fixed and the
zamindar would benefit from any increased production from the land.

Initial problem to zamindars-
----------------------------
The zamindars didn't invested in improving the land. The revenue that was fixed 
for the zamindars were unaffordable to zamindars. They lost their zamindari if
they failed to pay revenue. The company organised auctions to sold zamindari.

Loss of expected revenue to company in early 19th century-
----------------------------------------------------------
In early decade of 19th century, cutivation of expanded and markets rose. This
led to increase in income of zamindar and no gain to company. The company could
not demand more revenue, because it was fixed earlier.

Problem to the cultivator-
-------------------------
The cultivators found this system of fixed revenue extremely oppressive. The rent
that to be paid to zamindars were high and the cultivator had no securtiy over 
the land. To pay rent cultivator often take money from moneylaender. If they
fail to return money to the moneylender, they were evicted from the land.

Mahalwari system-
----------------
Devised by Holt Mackenzie in 1822. Under this system the estimated revenue has to
be paid by the village(mahal). The charge of collecting revenue was given to the
village headman. The revenues were collected based on the measurements and
assessment from of each of plots and the sum total ammonut was paid to the
company.

The munro system-
----------------
In munro system, the fields were surveyed separately and revenue assessment were
made directly with traditional zamindars. This system is was called ryotwari.
This system was applied on the south , because there were no tradional zamindars.
