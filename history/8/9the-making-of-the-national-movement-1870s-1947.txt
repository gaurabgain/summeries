THE EMERGENCE OF NATIONALISM
============================

==> Dissatisfaction of people-
-----------------------------
> As peoples were dissatisfied with british rule, they had some questions within
  them.
> People had questions as like, What is this country of india? For whom it is
  meant?
> The answer that gradually emerged was, India was the people of india, all the
  people irrespective of class,colour,caste,creed,language,gender.
> India, the country, its resources and systems were meant for all of them.
> Peoples realised that british were exercising control over resources of india
  and over people, and india could not be india until the control of british end.

==> Formation of political associations-
---------------------------------------
> The effect of that realisation can be realised by the formation of political
  associations after 1850. Mostly in 1870s and 1880s.
> Some notable associations were, Poona sarvajanik sabha, the indian association,
  the madras mahajan sabha, the bombay presidency association, the indian
  national congress.
> Although many of these associations functioned in specific parts of country.
  Their goals was for all the people of india, irrespective of religion, class,
  community.
> They worked on the idea that people should be sovereign. They believed that
  the indian people should be empowered to take decision regarding their affairs.

> 1878- The arms act passed, which disallow indians from possessing arms.
> 1878- The vernacular press act passed, this act allowed the government to
  seize the assets of newspapers including their printing press if the newspapers
  published anything that was found "objectionable".
> The purpose of vernacular press act was to silence those who were critical of
  the govenrment.

> 1883- The govenrment attempted to introduce The Ilbert bill, which provided
  for the trial of british or european persons by indians, and sought equality
  between british and indian judges in the country.
> Ilbert bill was opposed by white and they forced the government to withdraw
  the bill.
> Indians opposed this event. This event highlighted the racial attitudes of
  the british in india.

==> Establishment of the indian national congress (1885)-
--------------------------------------------------------
> The Ilbert bill controversy deepened the desire to form an all-india
  organisation of educated indians. The need of it had been felt since 1880.
> In december 1885, 72 delegates from all over the country met at bombay and
  established the indian national congress.

  tyabji, w.c. bonnerji, surendranath banerji, s. subramania iyer, romesh chandra
  dutt etc . Most of them were from bombay and calcutta.

> Naoroji was a businessman and publicist settled in london and was a member of
  the british parliament for a time. He guided the younger nationalists.

  from the various regions together.
