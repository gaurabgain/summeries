=================================================================================

THE EMERGENCE OF NATIONALISM
============================

==> Dissatisfaction of people-
-----------------------------
> As peoples were dissatisfied with british rule, they had some questions within
  them.
> People had questions as like, What is this country of india? For whom it is
  meant?
> The answer that gradually emerged was, India was the people of india, all the
  people irrespective of class,colour,caste,creed,language,gender.
> India, the country, its resources and systems were meant for all of them.
> Peoples realised that british were exercising control over resources of india
  and over people, and india could not be india until the control of british end.

==> Formation of political associations-
---------------------------------------
> The effect of that realisation can be realised by the formation of political
  associations after 1850. Mostly in 1870s and 1880s.
> Some notable associations were, Poona sarvajanik sabha, the indian association,
  the madras mahajan sabha, the bombay presidency association, the indian
  national congress.
> Although many of these associations functioned in specific parts of country.
  Their goals was for all the people of india, irrespective of religion, class,
  community.
> They worked on the idea that people should be sovereign. They believed that
  the indian people should be empowered to take decision regarding their affairs.

==> Dissatisfaction intensified (1870s-1880s)-
----------------------------------------------
> 1878- The arms act passed, which disallow indians from possessing arms.
> 1878- The vernacular press act passed, this act allowed the government to
  seize the assets of newspapers including their printing press if the newspapers
  published anything that was found "objectionable".
> The purpose of vernacular press act was to silence those who were critical of
  the govenrment.

> 1883- The govenrment attempted to introduce The Ilbert bill, which provided
  for the trial of british or european persons by indians, and sought equality
  between british and indian judges in the country.
> Ilbert bill was opposed by white and they forced the government to withdraw
  the bill.
> Indians opposed this event. This event highlighted the racial attitudes of
  the british in india.

==> Establishment of the indian national congress (1885)-
--------------------------------------------------------
> The Ilbert bill controversy deepened the desire to form an all-india
  organisation of educated indians. The need of it had been felt since 1880.
> In december 1885, 72 delegates from all over the country met at bombay and
  established the indian national congress.
> The early leadership included - dadabhai naoroji,pherozeshah mehta, badruddin
  tyabji, w.c. bonnerji, surendranath banerji, s. subramania iyer, romesh chandra
  dutt etc . Most of them were from bombay and calcutta.

> Naoroji was a businessman and publicist settled in london and was a member of
  the british parliament for a time. He guided the younger nationalists.
> A.O. Hume, a retired british official, also played a part in bringing indians
  from the various regions together.

A nation in the making
----------------------
==> Demands of congress on employment issues-
---------------------------------------------
> Congress demanded for high numbers of seats to indians in the government and
  administration.
> It wanted more indian representative in the legislative council, given more
  power to legislative and introduce new legislative where none exsisted.
> It demanded indians to be placed in high positions in government.
> It called for civil service examinations to be held in inida as well, not just
  in london.

> Congress demanded for indianisation of the administration was part of movement
  against racism.
> Indianisation was hoped that it could reduce the drain of wealth to england,
  since most of the high post in administration had white officials and they
  were sending major part of their salaries to home.
> White officials had their monopoly in jobs in administration.
> British generally assumed that indians are inferior for those positions of
  responsibility.

==> Demands of congress on law-
-------------------------------
> It demanded for the separation of the judiciary from the exective, repeal of
  the arms act, freedom of speech and expression.

==> Congress raised economic issues-
-----------------------------------
> Congress declared that british rule had led to poverty and famine.
> Increase in land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars.
> Exports of grain to europe had created food shortages.
> It demanded redction in revenue, cut in military expenditure, more funds for
  irrigation.
> Congress passed resolution on salt tax, treatment of indian labours abroad,
  sufferings of forest dwellers - caused by interfering forest administration.

==> Criticism of british rule by congress-
------------------------------------------
> The moderate leaders of congress wanted to develope public awareness about the
  injustice of british administration.
> They showed how british rule was leading to economic ruin of country by writing
  articles, publishing newspapers.
> They criticised british rule in their speeches.
> They sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public
  opinion.

> The leaders of congress felt that the british had respect for the ideals of
  freedom and justice. So, they would accept the demands of indians, so it was
  necessary to express these demands and make the govenrment aware of the
  feelings of indians.

"Freedom is our birthright"
--------------------------
> By 1890s many indians began to raise question about the moderate political
  style of congress.
> Bipin chandra pal from bengal, bal gangadhar tilak from maharashtra and lala
  lajpat rai from punjab began to explore more radical methods.
> They criticised the moderates for their "politics of prayers" and emphasised
  the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people
  must rely on their own strength,not on the "good intentions" of the government.
  People must fight for swaraj.
> Bal gangadhar tilak raised the slogan, "Freedom is my birthright and i shall
  have it".

==> Partition of bengal and the swadeshi movement-
--------------------------------------------------
> Viceroy Curzon partitioned bengal in 1905.
> Bengal was the largest province of british india at that time. It comprised of
  bengal,bihar and parts of odisha.
> The british gave "administrative convenience" as reason for the partiton of
  bengal. The convenience was closely tied to the interests of british officials
  and businessman.
> Instead of removing the non-bengali areas from the province , the government
  separated east bengal and merged it with assam.
> Perhaps the main british motives were to limit the influence of bengali
  politicians and to split the bengali people.

> The partition of bengal angered people all over india. All sections of the
  congress- the moderates and the radicals.
